## Futures

> Here are the features and improvements we plan to add to the tool in the future. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to share!

1. **Quick Password Generation**
   - ✅ Rapidly generates random passwords of specified lengths and strengths.
2. **Password Strength Check**
   - ✅ Assesses the strength of user-inputted passwords, providing visual feedback.
3. **Customizable Password Policy**
   - ⌛ Enables users to customize password generation rules, such as mandating the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and their minimum occurrences.
4. **Password History Management**
   - ⌛ Offers a secure means for users to store and manage their previously generated passwords (with emphasis on encrypted storage), including features to flag frequently used passwords and search for specific ones.
5. **Password Expiration Reminder**
   - ⌛ Implements a notification system that alerts users, based on their settings (e.g., every 90 days), when to change passwords for specific websites or applications.
6. **Password Synchronization & Backup**
   - ⌛ Provides cloud synchronization functionality, allowing users to sync their password database across multiple devices, ensuring secure access while facilitating cross-platform use.
7. **Security Assessment Report**
   - ⌛ Generates detailed reports on password security, analyzing the distribution of password strengths and reuse within the user's database, offering improvement suggestions.
8. **Password Leak Check**
   - ⌛ Integrates with an `API` (like `Have I Been Pwned`) to check if user-supplied passwords have been exposed in known data breaches, enhancing user awareness of password security.
9. **Random Passphrase Generation**
   - ⌛ In addition to traditional random strings, includes a dictionary-based passphrase generator that produces longer but more memorable passwords, such as “`CorrectHorseBatteryStaple`”.
10. **Multilingual Password Support**
    - ⌛ Expands character set support to allow for passwords containing non-English characters, catering to international users with specific needs.
11. **Graphical User Interface**
    - ⌛ Considers developing a graphical user interface (`GUI`) to enhance the user experience, particularly for those unfamiliar with command-line operations.
12. **Plug-in Based Development**
    - ⌛ Develops related **plugins** to enrich usage scenarios, including browser plugins, `IDE` integrations, and apps for multiple platforms.
13. **Educational Module**
    - ⌛Incorporates educational content on password security, covering common password cracking methods and guidelines for creating and managing strong passwords, to boost user awareness.
